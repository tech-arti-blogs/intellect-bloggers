<p>Various Cybercrime techniques are:</p>
<p>1) Web Servers</p>
<p>The most suitable way to gain access to our data is to attack the web applications. The attackers distribute their harmful malicious code through web servers. They choose web servers because it is an easy way to steal over data such as transaction details, passwords used etc. Thus, we must use a safe browser which contains a protective server.</p>
<p>2) Cloud computing and its services</p>
<p>As all the organizations are adopting themselves to the cloud infrastructure, aspects should also be made strong. Cloud services introduce various models and some people adopt it.
without analyzing whether it has any issues or not. Thus, to protect our data in cloud security enhancement is necessary.</p>
<p>3) Mobile networks</p>
<p>Mobile networks are a largest security threat that exists and a loop hole for attackers. As we use some unsafe mobile networks in all important situations such as transactions, we should be cautious. Thus, mobile networks are highly prone to cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>4) Encryption</p>
<p>Encoding the message using keys and decoding the same message in other side by the keys is referred to as cryptography. To avoid attacks by eavesdroppers or middleman attackerâ€™s encryptions technology can be used. Encryption transforms the plain text to a cipher text and decryption again converts cipher text to plain text. Private Key, public key or hybrid key can be used. For secure transmission such as data transfer over network this methodology can be used.</p>
