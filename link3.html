<p>Plenty of data are present in the world but there exists a fear when it comes to data security. A term called ‘cybercrime’ evolves. Cybercrime is an illegal criminal activity which is done by various ways such as hacking, piracy and others. This is done by criminals to attain privacy. The growth of cybercrime is high. On September 5, 2019 NDTV announced that, during the period of April 2017 to January 2018, over 22000 websites were hacked in India. The count is too high for a ten-month period. Many technologies such as cloud computing, big data, mobile computing etc. provides means for data storage and analysis but data security is not yet achieved completely. Nowadays, privacy of data is becoming impossible. The only way to protect our data is to enhance cyber security. Cyber security is also a technology which focuses on data protection, privacy and safeguards the data from malicious attacks. In all aspects, cyber security is essential. All aspects involve crimes against people, government, business and others. The companies which switch their infrastructure to recent technologies also update the cloud security to protect the privacy. This paper reviews on various types of cyberattacks and tools used. Also, the techniques adopted by cyber criminals and cyber security along with the statistical analysis part with recent data were also discussed.</p>
