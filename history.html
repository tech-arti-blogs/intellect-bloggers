<p>The evolution of e–learning arises from various factors such as insufficient time to learn things as well as insufficient persons to teach it. </p>
<p>When computers came into usage, in 1980’s there is need to learn it. At that time, they can learn computers only during office hours because there is no personal computers or laptops. But this learning affected the office works and productivity decreased </p>
<p>Later, the arrival of multimedia technology in the period of 1985 – 1995. The usage of CD – ROMs, Windows 3.1, power point, Macintosh came into existence. The insufficiency of instructors was also managed by these advancements. Using CD, the portability also increased.</p>
<p>Around 1990’s the world wide web (WWW) evolved. This created more learning opportunities. Many instructors from various parts of the world started to share their knowledge. Also, the growth of technology enhanced the communication which led the students to clarify their doubts via E-mail..</p>
<p>Even though there is a downfall, large files can be shared via web. So, floppy disk is used. Later in 20th century people started moving from CD ROMs to USB. Large computers were replaced by portable compact computers. Network support of Java / IP as well as audio / video support were high.</p>
<p>Then the invention of smart phones and PDA’s completely changed the world’s learning process. Smart phones with internet connectivity made the learning more convenient. In future, scope of E – learning will be further increased to a greater extent.</p>
