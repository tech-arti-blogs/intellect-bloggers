<p>Some of the technologies initiated by VIA technologies in 2001 enriched green computing. Some of the technologies are</p>
<p>1.	Carbon-Free Computing:</p>
<p>Gases such as carbon-dioxide methane are would increase the Earth’s temperature leading to consequences such as melting of glaciers, raising of sea levels, floods, droughts, etc... Thus, an initiative to reduce carbon footprint made by the users is implemented.</p>
<p>2.	Solar Computing:</p>
<p>Solar energy is a renewable energy source. Utilizing it sufficiently is also implemented by via technologies. Even though, the cost of installation of solar cells are high, once installed it saves more power. Understanding this, the company switched to solar computing.</p>
<p>3.	Lead – Free Computing:</p>
<p>European union introduced a policy called Restriction of Hazardous-substances Directive (ROHS) in February 2003. Due to its effect, hazardous material such as lead is restricted for usage in manufacturing of any kind of electrical or electronic equipment. For this, VIA technologies, initiated lead – free computing. i.e. they introduced a new composition consisting of copper, tin and silver.</p>
<p>4.	Energy – efficient Computing:</p>
<p>Energy - efficient is achieved when low power consumption and small form – factor is achieved. The introduction of efficient processors by VIA technologies allows it to adopt to solar operated devices as well as it emits less carbon at its operation.</p>
	<p>Like VIA technologies many organizations are switching to green computing technologies.</p>
