<p>Tremendous amount of data is growing in trillion in recent days. The worldâ€™s data is doubling rapidly. Data science and big data analytics are the point of focus of research people for analysing these data sets. This section describes some of typical research challenges in big data analytics.</p>

	<p class= "w3-center"> A. INTERNET OF THINGS FOR BIG DATA ANALYTICS</p>

<p>The challenge failed in IoT is acquisition of knowledge. Sufficient infrastructure to analyse IoT data sets are needed. The devices and sensors of IoT produce continuous data sets and specialized tools to extract necessary information from it. Algorithms of machine learning and computational intelligence are the only solutions of handling data sets of IoT. Thus, IoT is a technology that automates our entire lifestyle and its performance would be more efficient when the above challenges are solved.</p>

	<p class= "w3-center">B. CLOUD COMPUTING FOR BIG DATA ANALYTICS</p>

Cloud is an infrastructure that provides us huge data storage, computing the cloud storage datasets involves analysis of data. Cloud infrastructure offers various cloud models for its users. But though the infrastructure should also provide analysis tools to acquire and extract meaningful information from datasets. This, cloud is a vast storage provider and it would be more efficient when above challenge is solved.

	<p class= "w3-center">C. QUANTUM COMPUTING FOR BIG DATA ANALYSIS</p>

<p>Quantum computer is a computer which can solve the given exponential data set simultaneously and rapidly. The data which is present in Terabytes are gathered together which is collectively known as big data. The problems of big data can be solved more quickly. The quantum computer bits are referred to as qubits or quantum bits. The big data problems can be solved by using large scale quantum computers. Thus, it is the challenging task for future generation to construct the quantum computer that solves the problems of big data.</p>
