<p>In the field of information technologies, many initiatives towards green information and communication technologies i.e. green ICT have been introduced. Some important initiatives are:</p>
<p>1.	Improved Data centre:</p>
<p>As we all know that all the information in IT are stored in efficient data centres. Improvisation of data centres include applying proper cooling methods to data centres such as improving airflow, supply of concentrate cold air to servers and usage of water-based air conditions in racks and server arrangements.</p>
<p>2.	Better Storage methods:</p>
<p>Data from the organisation are on a large-scale. Hence storage drives are used for storage of data. Power sources for energising these drives are also on a huge usage. To reduce this, we can use large capacity storage drives and should perform proper audits in data centres to avoid data redundancies.</p>
<p>3.	Virtualization techniques:</p>
<p>Server forms and data centres used by the organisations utilize large space. All data servers is used in a huge amount. By using virtualization, a virtual platform is used and also load balancing techniques would make efficient use of servers.</p>
<p>4.	Using thin clients:</p>
<p>Thin clients are a virtual desktop that uses separate mouse, monitor, and keyboard for each users but CPU is a shared by all the users.</p>
<p>5.	Use of renewable energy sources:</p>
<p>Usage of renewable energy for data centres such as solar energy leads to efficient consumption of energy.</p>
