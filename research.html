<p>High performance computing systems such as super computers, real time computers etc... Consume large scale of power as well as cooling mechanisms. In this age of computers, it is inevitable to stop the use of computers. Natural resources are getting exploited on a higher quantity for computing systems.</p>
<p>Researchers consider this as an important challenge. Some other research challenges are discussed below:</p>
<p>1.	Design of data centres:</p>
<p>The design of large data centres should be mode as energy efficient. The concept of PUE is used as a standard for this. PUE stands for Power Usage Effectiveness. But designing large data centres in an efficient manner is really a challenging task.</p>
<p>2.	Green Software:</p>
<p>To improve sustainable development in IT, the developers started learning Green Software movement. Many companies started moving towards Green Software.</p>
<p>3.	Data centres cooling using wireless sensors:</p>
<p>Data centres are considered to be backbone for organizations. Power efficiency and data centre management can be improved using wireless sensor network.</p>
<p>4.	Green Maturity Model:</p>
<p>Green computing considers energy reduction as a best measure. The green characteristics at each level in virtualization are depicted by Green maturity model.</p>
<p>5.	Reduction of complexity in architecture:</p>
<p>The architectural complexity of the system means the component dependency in the system. A better mechanism such as Intelâ€™s core 2 duo can be used which consumes power to run only necessary components for any computations.</p>
